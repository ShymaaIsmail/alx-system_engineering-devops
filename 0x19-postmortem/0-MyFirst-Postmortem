**Issue Summary:**

**Duration:**  
Start Time: April 13, 2024, 10:00 PM UTC  
End Time: April 14, 2024, 2:00 AM UTC  

**Impact:**  
The service outage affected 30% of our users, resulting in slow response times and intermittent errors when accessing the application.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers.

**Timeline:**

- **10:30 PM UTC:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased latency.
- **10:35 PM UTC:** Engineering team notified about the issue.
- **10:45 PM UTC:** Initial investigation focused on backend server performance and database connectivity.
- **11:15 PM UTC:** Misleading assumption made that the database was experiencing issues due to recent updates.
- **11:30 PM UTC:** Incident escalated to senior engineering team for further investigation.
- **12:00 AM UTC:** Load balancer configuration checked, revealing discrepancies in traffic distribution.
- **1:00 AM UTC:** Load balancer settings corrected to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers.
- **2:00 AM UTC:** Service fully restored, and users began experiencing normal response times.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause Explanation:**  
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused uneven distribution of traffic, resulting in overloaded servers and degraded performance.

**Resolution Details:**  
The issue was fixed by correcting the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers. Additionally, automated monitoring was implemented to detect and alert on similar misconfigurations in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements/Fixes:**  
1. Regular review of load balancer configurations to ensure proper traffic distribution.
2. Enhanced monitoring and alerting for load balancer performance and configuration changes.
3. Implementation of automated testing for load balancer configurations to prevent similar incidents.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**  
1. Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify and correct any inconsistencies.
2. Develop documentation outlining best practices for load balancer configuration management.
3. Schedule regular training sessions for engineering teams to familiarize them with load balancer management and troubleshooting procedures.
