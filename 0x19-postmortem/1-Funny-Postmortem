**Issue Summary:**

**Duration:**  
Start Time: April 13, 2024, 10:00 PM UTC  
End Time: April 14, 2024, 2:00 AM UTC  

**Impact:**  
The service decided it needed a nap, affecting 30% of our users who were left twiddling their thumbs, staring at loading screens, and wondering if they accidentally stumbled into the dark corners of the internet.

**Root Cause:**  
Our load balancer was playing favorites, like a kid picking their favorite candy from the jar, resulting in some servers being overloaded while others enjoyed a siesta.

**Timeline:**

- **10:30 PM UTC:** Alert bells started ringing louder than a fire alarm in a library, indicating increased latency.
- **10:35 PM UTC:** Engineering team was rudely awakened from their peaceful evening to tackle the issue.
- **10:45 PM UTC:** Initial investigation pointed fingers at the backend servers and sent the database into a panic.
- **11:15 PM UTC:** Assumed the database was throwing a tantrum due to recent updates, but it turns out it was innocent this time.
- **11:30 PM UTC:** Called in the senior engineering squad to crack the case wide open.
- **12:00 AM UTC:** Discovered the load balancer was playing favorites and giving some servers more attention than others.
- **1:00 AM UTC:** Load balancer settings were corrected, and the servers were given equal love and attention once again.
- **2:00 AM UTC:** Service woke up from its impromptu slumber, ready to serve users faster than a caffeinated barista.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause Explanation:**  
The load balancer, like a distracted parent, was unfairly distributing traffic among servers, causing some to be overworked while others were left twiddling their digital thumbs.

**Resolution Details:**  
We put the load balancer on a timeout and corrected its behavior, ensuring all servers received a fair share of the workload. Additionally, we installed a digital nanny to monitor its behavior and intervene if it starts playing favorites again.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements/Fixes:**  
1. Scheduled regular check-ins with the load balancer to ensure it's behaving itself.
2. Implemented automated monitoring to catch any future misbehaviors before they turn into a full-blown outage.
3. Conducted load balancer therapy sessions to address any underlying issues contributing to its favoritism tendencies.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**  
1. Conduct a load balancer configuration review to identify and correct any biases.
2. Develop a load balancer behavior handbook outlining acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.
3. Organize a load balancer intervention to address its favoritism tendencies and encourage fair treatment of all servers.
